## Overview of the UFO sighting analysis

- Work with JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- Recognize the differences and similarities between JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

There are always UFO and data regarding UFOs. The data with the information of the sightings including the place, date, and shape are included. The task includes displaying a table of the data in Javascript form. The table was then adjusted with the help of HTML/CSS to display a more appealing set up.

## Results

The results are shown below. In order to perform a search, a user can fill out the filter search and this will result in matches appearing.

## Summary

One main drawback I see is that there is no button to click after filling out the search bars. The site automatically returns the information the user is requesting. I also recommend that having the latest UFO sightings listed onto the website will be more beneficial as people may want to look into recent cases. Another recommendation I have includes the possibility of drop down options in the search bars which may help users find the cities, days and shape at a faster pace.
